- This is a simple project to demonstrate how files are getting corrupted.
- Basically, you read the binary content of a file.. Perform a 1's complement on every bytes.. And BOOM!! File gets corrupted.
- Perform the same operation again on the corrupted file.. You will restore all the bytes to its original value. Your file gets restored.
- While corrupting the file, you take the file and store it in the backups folder for safety reasons.
